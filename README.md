A simple yet sufficient android application to fetch: 
- Popular Movies
- Top Rated Movies
- Now Playing Movies
- Upcoming Movies
using api from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## Why this project

This project is built to show how to build modern android applications following [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) with kotlin and some of the android [jetpack libraries](https://developer.android.com/jetpack).

## Getting started

After cloning the project, find the `gradle.properties` in the `.gradle` folder inside the project directory.
Add `TrailerMoviesApp_ApiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY"` to that file.

Libraries Used
--------------
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [Room][16] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [Paging][3] - Load and display small chunks of data at a time.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [WorkManager][18] - Manage your Android background jobs.

* Third party
  * [Glide][90] for image loading
  * [Gson][4] Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation
  * [Retrofit][5] A type-safe HTTP client for Android
  * [Timber][6] A logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
